# Project Title

Project aims to estimate similarity between areas of Dry Tropical Forests (**DTF**) with or without confirmed presence of exotic species
Current version is 3.0
## Getting Started

The project will use the original database of exotic records and the remnants of Dry Tropical Forests. 
Two main files in R are required: *BST_Invasoras.R* and *BST_InvasorasOut.R*

### Prerequisites

The following libraries are required

```
library(MASS)
```

### Installing and Running

1. Load the original database inside the folder you will run the projectA step 2. Run the BST_Invasive.R
3. Review graphics created on the folder **PCAgraphs**
Say what the step will be

```
ggsave(file.path(InD,'selgraph.jpeg),p,width=10,height=8)
```

4. Now run *BSTInvasiveOut.R*

```
open Arcgis to join the results of the modelling
```
